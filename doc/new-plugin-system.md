# New Plugin System

`@lightscript/parser` includes a new plugin system that extends the builtin system from `@babel/parser`.

**TODO** Document it.

In the meantime, see `src/plugins/PluginRegistration.lsc` for an example of how to register plugins, and `src/plugins/tildeCall.lsc` for an example of how to build a plugin.
